Data Analysis project using BC Housing data for Comp 115

This project analyzes 2016 census data from BC's 215 Community Health Service Areas (CHSAs) and 5 Provincial Health Areas (PHAs). The data is related to housing costs, rent subsidies, and income. 

The objective of the project is to determine if subsidies are being distributed equitably across the province, first by considering rent and housing costs in the most expensive CHSAs, and secondly by analyzing the data at a regional level by considering the subsidy rates in each of the 5 PHAs.

I used dictionaries to represent the data with the values being CHSAs and the keys being various statistics such as median monthly rent, median monthly income, and rent subsidy rate. I computed my own statistic, 'percent income on rent', which represents the median percent of monthly income spent on rent, by finding the median rent after subsidy and dividing this by median monthly income. 

My conclusions were that in the case of looking at each CHSA, more data would be needed to determine where to best allocate subsidies, but that a reallocation would be advised considering some CHSAs with low subsidy rates and high housing costs. In taking a more regional approach, however, subsidies are more reasonably distributed across the province as a whole.
